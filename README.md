- 👋 Hi, I’m @hitrojo11

I have been unsuccessfully trying to learn coding for the past fourteen years.
But I still want to learn it. I have tried many approaches and many languages,
(trying to learn many languages without mastering one is I know not a good approach),
yet I have never really gone much beyond writing ‘hello world’ or determining whether a number is ‘prime’ or not.
Now, I want to try an even more hands-on approach,
and start working on a project small/big under a mentor or with a teammate.

I still believe learning coding is one part of my quest...
