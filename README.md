- 👋 Hi, I’m @hitrojo11

I have been unsuccessfully trying to learn coding for the past fourteen years.
But I still want to learn it. I have tried many approaches and many languages,
(trying to learn many languages without mastering one is I know not a good approach),
yet I have never really gone much beyond writing ‘hello world’ or determining whether a number is ‘prime’ or not.
Now, I want to try an even more hands-on approach,
and start working on a project small/big under a mentor or with a teammate.

I am an instrumentation engineer with two years of experience working for a multinational consultancy firm.
For all my time I was working I felt something was missing and to find the answer for that I left all that
and for the past six years I have spent time doing not much but an occasional odd job in search of finding my answer
to the question which roughly translates in words as 'What is work?'.

I still believe learning coding is one part of my quest...
